## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Skill

**Claude Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codezz/brainrepo.git .claude/skills/brainrepo
```

**OpenClaw:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codezz/brainrepo.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/brainrepo
```

### 2. Initialize Your Brain

Tell your AI:
```
"Set up brainrepo"
```

The AI will:
1. Create the folder structure at `~/Documents/brainrepo/`
2. Initialize git (optional)
3. You're ready to go!

### 3. Start Capturing

```
"Save this: [your thought]"
"New project: [project name]"
"Add person: [name]"
```

## 📂 Structure Created

```
your-brain/
├── Inbox/          # 📥 Quick capture (process daily)
├── Projects/       # 🎯 Active work with deadlines
│   └── project-name/
│       └── index.md
├── Areas/          # 🔄 Ongoing responsibilities
│   ├── personal-growth/
│   └── family/
├── Notes/          # 💡 Permanent atomic knowledge
├── Resources/      # 📚 External links & references
├── Journal/        # 📅 Daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── People/         # 👥 One note per person
├── Tasks/          # ✅ Centralized task tracking
│   └── index.md
└── Archive/        # 📦 Completed projects
```

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Capture (Anytime)
Don't think, just dump:
```
"Save this: Had an idea about improving onboarding flow"
```

### 2. Process (Evening, 5-10 min)
Move each Inbox item to its permanent home:
- Idea about a project? → `Projects/`
- Reusable knowledge? → `Notes/`
- About a person? → `People/`

### 3. Retrieve (Anytime)
```
"What do I know about [topic]?"
"Find notes related to [project]"
```
